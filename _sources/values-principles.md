# Values and principles

## Operationalising the Turing's Values in Community Management
 
- **Transparency**: Prioritise transparency and clarity in all our communications, collaborations and engagement pathways -- this is our responsibility and duty towards each other as peers and the communities we lead.
- **Leadership**: Apply open leadership practices in our community-building processes that encourage our community members to co-create additional knowledge and understanding, and apply that knowledge.
- **Inclusivity**: Embed equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (EDIA) approaches in all our work and use community-based knowledge to improve the community or address the identified problem.
- **Respect**: Maintain respectful co-creation processes in the team and the communities by providing clear ways to participate, engage and lead through regular and ongoing opportunities.
- **Trust**: Build trust in the community by making implicit knowledge explicit and providing access to resources that enable everyone to discover, display and directly use their knowledge and skills.
- **Integrity**: Ensure ethical integrity through the involvement of community members, especially those impacted by our work.

## RCM Team's Guiding Principles

1. **Collaboration**: Actively break down silos by enabling knowledge exchange across all projects through collaboration and joint efforts.
1. **Communication**: Communicate openly about your project, communities the challenges you are seeking to address and solutions that have emerged.
1. **Professionalisation**: Uphold the highest personal and professional standards and share opportunities to co-create knowledge and infrastructure around community management and open research practices as a team.
1. **Open Leadership**: Apply open leadership to foster open spaces for community engagement and proactively find opportunities to collaborate with each other in extending the goals and impact of open Research Community Management at the institutional level.
1. **Peer support**: Create a supportive and non-judgmental environment to engage each other, celebrate successes, admit errors and draw learnings from each other's work.
1. **Dealing with Conflict**: Be willing to work through conflicts to resolution openly and constructively, as well as manage any relevant conflict of interest effectively.
1. **Principle of change**: Embrace the framework of change when responding to the needs of communities and stakeholders:
    * **Change is a fundamental** part of growth and effective change must come from within individuals and groups. 
    * Community engagement/growth **starts by first changing ourselves**, our attitudes, language and the way we view the world around us.
    * Communities are most successful when true partnerships exist and **power or control is delegated and vested effectively** within the community.
