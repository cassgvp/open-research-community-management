# Background

Building communities in data science is crucial for bringing together diverse stakeholders, enabling knowledge exchange and co-creating a collaborative system in which AI research can thrive.​ At the Turing, this vision is realised by the integration of Research Community Managers (RCMs) in projects where multiple internal and external stakeholders are involved. As the visible and most connected members of the project, they apply Open Research and Community Management approaches to foster Communities of Practice in the Turing’s work.

> Research Community Managers empower the diverse stakeholders of a research community to co-create, maintain and sustain data science projects and outputs that they can equitably benefit from.
