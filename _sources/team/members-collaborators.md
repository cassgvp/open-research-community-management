# Members and Collaborators

The **Open Research Community Management** team members, RCMs, are TPS researchers at the Turing who provide community management expertise in the Turing's teams, projects and programmes in the organisation.
As a core capability of the Turing, the RCM team supports the convening power of the Turing Institute across different interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder projects.
They also work closely with other core capabilities including the Research Application Management team, the Skills Team and the Research Engineering Group.

RCM team members apply open science and FAIR (Findable, accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices in the development, maintenance and sharing of community/research resources.
Many of the RCMs work on projects under the Health Programme or projects involving sensitive/confidential data, where they ensure and operationalise the principle of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary".

All resources developed to support/facilitate their work as RCMs and as experts from their respective projects will be shared via this repository (by removing any project-specific sensitive information).
Practices and case studies learned from their work will be shared in *The Turing Way* wherever possible.

The RCM team also hosts members with community-oriented roles currently collaborating with TPS or *The Turing Way*

New members are onboarded by the team lead and added as a contributor to this project repository.
Please [create an issue for your induction](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/community-manager-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=onboarding&template=NEW_MEMBERS.md&title=%5BINDUCTION%5D) (if not already created by the project lead).

If you are not already collaborating with TPS, but are interested in community management, please join *The Turing Way* community.
You can also contact [Malvika Sharan](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk) for any questions or resources regarding community management developed by the team.
