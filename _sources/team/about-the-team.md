## About the Team

The TPS Research Programme hosts all RCMs within the **Open Research Community Management** team.
As community experts, each RCM is allocated to specific projects across different programs and as a team, they connect those projects as a joint-up system of open source and reproducible software, data, people and processes. 
By sharing knowledge as they develop in different projects, both in terms of scientific outcomes and socio-technical approaches applied to achieve them, RCMs break down the silos that traditionally exist in a research environment.

RCMs combine a range of socio-technical skills including domain research expertise, scientific communications and stakeholder engagement approaches. 
Among others, their core responsibilities include ensuring access to skills and resources that different people and groups within the project need to meaningfully participate in and build something greater than the sum of its parts. 
Through collaboration, upskilling and resource development, they make implicit knowledge explicit so that everyone who wants to can get involved.
They provide information and processes for enabling members in our communities to move from the position of spectators or users to developers and leaders in the project.
RCMs facilitate open and collaborative work of others, while often taking care of many background works needed to make tangible and visible work of their communities possible. 
They embed best practices for ensuring EDIA (Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility), collaboration, maintenance, acknowledgement and the impact of community-based work.
As a team, RCMs conduct research, build shared frameworks, create opportunities for skill-building and provide appropriate support systems for each other to exchange best practices from their work.
