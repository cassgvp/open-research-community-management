## Welcome to the Research Community Managers Wiki

The [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) programme at The Alan Turing Institute, under the leadership of Dr Kirstie Whitaker, represents a cross-cutting set of initiatives which seek to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all and to empower a global, decentralised network of people who connect data with domain experts.

Led by Dr Malvika Sharan, TPS Senior Researcher for Open Research, TPS hosts the [Open Research Community Management](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) team with all Research Community Managers (RCMs) working across multiple teams, projects and programmes at the Institute.

All members of this team also participate in [*The Turing Way*](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) -- an Open Source, Open Collaboration and Community-driven guide to data science, co-led by Kirstie (who is also the founder of the project) and Malvika.
Part of the Research Community Managers' role is to engage with and contribute to *The Turing Way* as TPS staff members of the project.

Members from within the Turing programmes working in similar positions, as well as members from projects collaborating with TPS/*The Turing Way* outside the Turing, referred to as "collaborators in community roles" in this document, are invited to join this team based on formal project or team-based collaboration.

Anyone interested in the work of this team from outside the Turing or non-collaborators is invited to collaborate with us on *The Turing Way*.
For further questions and information, please get in touch with Malvika by emailing [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).

<!-- Members of Open Research Community Building team will ensure that research and data-driven AI solutions at the Turing use and build on open source tools, practices and systems by empowering people in the research community with open research skills. Building on the successes of the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme, Community Managers advance and scale the bidirectional flow of knowledge, resources and evidence for high-quality research within the Institute, as well as connect them across national and international data science communities. The aim is to empower Communities of Practice (CoP) at the Turing and more widely by granting them access to the skills and support they need to participate, collaborate and build something that is bigger than the sum of its part. -->
