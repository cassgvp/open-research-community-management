# Working with *The Turing Way*

All members of the Open Research Community Management team should take time to learn details in [*The Turing Way* core documents](./the-turing-way-core).
All community managers are onboarded as the core staff members of The *Turing Way* as part of their time is allocated to TPS and *The Turing Way*. 

Their engagement with *The Turing Way* project and community should help them understand how they can:
- enable reproducibility, open communication and ethical research in their projects and Communities of Practice they build.
- identify people, projects and resources that are crucial for the development, maintenance and sustainability of their projects.
- interconnect their work with other projects and communities in the wider landscape of data science and open research.
- facilitate openness, collaboration and transparent reporting, even when not all components of their projects can be made public.
- find support for their community work and in exchange support others' work, especially when it is closely aligned with their projects.
- enhance the technical understanding required in their work and share them more widely via *The Turing Way* (chapters, tutorials, templates or events).
